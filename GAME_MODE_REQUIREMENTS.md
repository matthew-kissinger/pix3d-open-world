# Game Mode Requirements

## Overview
We have one game mode - I want us to be able to select from two game modes on the start screen.

## Game Mode 1: Zone Control
- The first game mode will be the current one and it should be called "Zone Control"
- It is a smaller scale milsim

## Game Mode 2: Open Frontier
I want to scale it. Instead of 3 zones and 1 HQ each team will have 3 HQs and there will be 10 zones over a much larger open world.

### Spawning System
- The player can spawn at any HQ or captured zone just like the NPCs can spawn at HQs or captured zone
- Their side HQ that is

### World Scale
- It will be much farther apart - we want maybe like a 2x2 mile rough area that doesn't actually have a boundary
- There just isn't zones that are that far out (yet)

### Map System
- We want to make it so that there is not only a minimap (which needs a working compass)
- But also "M" to hold to see the full map and where you are and where you are facing
- This should be a good mil sim like feel

### UI/UX Improvements
- Improve the start screen and the HUD and minimap and map
- Upgrade the game to have a frontier war game mode

### Optimization & Gameplay
- Have it be optimized
- There should be a lot more enemies but it should be a much longer game mode
- The current game mode takes like 3 min
- The open frontier game mode should last like 15 minutes
- Should feel like an immersive mil sim experience and fun and engaging
