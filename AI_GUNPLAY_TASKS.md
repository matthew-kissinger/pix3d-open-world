# AI Gunplay Implementation Tasks

## Step 2 - AI Gunplay Under Same Rules as Player

### Core Objective
Transform the game so AI combatants (both allies and enemies) fight using the same gunplay mechanics as the player, with skill-based modifiers for realism and fairness.

## Pre-Implementation Research
- [x] Research modern AI combat techniques for web-based games
- [x] Study squad-based AI architectures and performance optimization
- [x] Analyze existing codebase structure (EnemySystem, GunplayCore, FirstPersonWeapon)
- [x] Identify available assets (US vs OPFOR soldier sprites)
